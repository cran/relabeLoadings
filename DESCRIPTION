Description: In confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), structural constraints
    typically ensure that the model is identified up to all possible reflections,
    i.e., column sign changes of the matrix of loadings. Such reflection invariance
    is problematic for Bayesian CFA when the reflection modes are not well separated
    in the posterior distribution. Imposing rotational constraints -- fixing
    some loadings to be zero or positive in order to pick a factor solution that
    corresponds to one reflection mode -- may not provide a satisfactory solution
    for Bayesian CFA. The function 'relabel' uses the relabeling algorithm of
    Erosheva and Curtis to correct for sign invariance in MCMC draws from CFA
    models. The MCMC draws should come from Bayesian CFA models that are fit without
    rotational constraints.
